# Portfolio Website

## Functionalities

- Fully Responsive between mobile and full HD resolutions
- Smooth resizing and in page scrolling
- Animated, sortable projects section
- A sticky navigation that moves out of your way when you do not need it
- A form that actually directs messages to me, using Fromspring

## Practiced Skills

This was my first project using TailwindCSS! and honestly it is quite a bit of a shock going from a CSS style sheet to inline classes to style my componenents, there are some tweaks I still need to make but having that kind of proximity between componenent and styling makes sense, as explained in [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQuTF-bkOgc&ab_channel=Theo-t3%E2%80%A4gg).

Overall it was very rewarding to do something pretty for a change!

## Improvements

I believe this website could evidently still benefit from some improvements, wich I may or may not do in the future:

- Improve the scrolling through menus experience on mobile.
- Projects section could be prettier, the buttons on the cards there are also problematic
- Use a color with better contrast for socials SVG's
