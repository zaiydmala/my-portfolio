          I'm a passionate programmer that enjoys the <span>thrill</span> of
          learning. I have a passion for creating interactive and minimalist web designs 
          that are both visually appealing and easy to use.
          With HTML, CSS, React, JavaScript, TypeScript, Git/Github and Webpack under my belt, 
          I have a strong foundation in web development.

        I love applying responsive design principles and watching my web pages shrink into mobile screens and still look amazing. 
        It feels oddly satisfying ðŸ¤Œ I think in a way I am kind of like those web pages;<br/><br/>
        <span>I am moldable, but I still keep my creative flare intactðŸ”¥</span>
